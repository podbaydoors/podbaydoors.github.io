#About Me

Computer games have fascinated me for as long as I remember. To me, programming a game is like being the creator of your own world. Orson Welles once likened moviemaking to "the biggest electric train set a boy ever had", but they didn't have video games back then. 

I've been fortuante to work in the games industry for almost 30 years.

This is my personal site where I discuss my hobby projects.
